- [x] Define subscription data schema 
- [x] Configure local persistence layer (IndexedDB or localStorage)
- [x] Create initial data loading mechanism
- [x] Implement basic CRUD operations using TinyBase

### Core UI Components
- [x] Create basic layout and navigation structure
- [x] Build subscription list view component
- [x] Implement subscription detail view
- [x] Create subscription add/edit forms
- [x] Add deletion confirmation dialog
- [ ] Implement search, sorting, and filtering functionality

### Dashboard and Visualization
- [x] Create dashboard overview page

- [ ] Add basic spending visualization

### Offline-First Features
- [ ] Implement client-side reminder generation
- [x] Add offline status indicator
- [ ] Create local notification system for renewal reminders
- [ ] Test all functionality in offline mode

## Phase 3: Backend Integration (After Local-First Complete)

### Backend Setup
- [x] Initialize NestJS project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure ESLint, Prettier
- [x] Create database module with Turso connection
- [x] Design database schema matching TinyBase model
- [x] Set up simple authentication for single user
- [x] Create API endpoints for subscriptions CRUD operations

- [x] Implement synchronization endpoints
- [ ] Add server-side validation

### Synchronization Logic
- [x] Add online/offline detection
- [x] Implement data synchronization mechanism
- [x] Create conflict resolution strategy
- [x] Build sync status indicators
- [ ] Test synchronization edge cases

## Phase 4: Additional Features

- [ ] Implement data export functionality
- [ ] Add data import capability
- [ ] Create server-side reminder generation
- [ ] Implement email notification service

## Phase 5: Testing, Refinement, and Deployment

- [x] Write unit tests for backend API endpoints
- [x] Create automated tests using test-driven development
- [x] Fix linting and TypeScript errors
- [ ] Perform comprehensive testing of offline capabilities
- [ ] Test synchronization between devices
- [ ] Fix bugs and edge cases
- [ ] Deploy to Fly.io

## Phase 6: Post-Launch

- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Make improvements based on personal usage
- [ ] Implement future considerations as needed
