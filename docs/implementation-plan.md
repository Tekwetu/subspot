# Implementation Plan: Personal Subscription Manager (Local-First Approach)

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

- [x] Set up React + TypeScript + Vite project
- [x] Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript
- [x] Configure TailwindCSS
- [x] Create GitHub repository with README

## Phase 2: Local-First Frontend with TinyBase

### TinyBase Setup and Data Modeling
- [x] Set up TinyBase store
- [x] Define subscription data schema 
- [x] Configure local persistence layer (IndexedDB or localStorage)
- [x] Create initial data loading mechanism
- [x] Implement basic CRUD operations using TinyBase

### Core UI Components
- [x] Create basic layout and navigation structure
- [x] Build subscription list view component
- [x] Implement subscription detail view
- [x] Create subscription add/edit forms
- [x] Add deletion confirmation dialog
- [ ] Implement search, sorting, and filtering functionality

### Dashboard and Visualization
- [x] Create dashboard overview page
- [x] Implement summary section (total costs, subscription count)
- [x] Build upcoming renewals list component
- [ ] Add basic spending visualization

### Offline-First Features
- [ ] Implement client-side reminder generation
- [x] Add offline status indicator
- [ ] Create local notification system for renewal reminders
- [ ] Test all functionality in offline mode

## Phase 3: Backend Integration (After Local-First Complete)

### Backend Setup
- [x] Initialize NestJS project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure ESLint, Prettier
- [x] Create database module with Turso connection
- [x] Design database schema matching TinyBase model
- [x] Set up simple authentication for single user
- [ ] Create API endpoints matching TinyBase operations
- [ ] Implement synchronization endpoints
- [ ] Add server-side validation

### Synchronization Logic
- [x] Add online/offline detection
- [ ] Implement data synchronization mechanism
- [ ] Create conflict resolution strategy
- [x] Build sync status indicators
- [ ] Test synchronization edge cases

## Phase 4: Additional Features

- [ ] Implement data export functionality
- [ ] Add data import capability
- [ ] Create server-side reminder generation
- [ ] Implement email notification service

## Phase 5: Testing, Refinement, and Deployment

- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Perform comprehensive testing of offline capabilities
- [ ] Test synchronization between devices
- [ ] Fix bugs and edge cases
- [ ] Deploy to Fly.io

## Phase 6: Post-Launch

- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Make improvements based on personal usage
- [ ] Implement future considerations as needed

## Technical Implementation Progress

### Frontend Data Layer (TinyBase)
- [x] Implemented schema-based typing for TinyBase store
- [x] Created subscription data model with all required fields
- [x] Set up local persistence using localStorage
- [x] Built React context provider for store access
- [x] Created useSubscriptions hook with CRUD operations
- [x] Implemented calculation utilities (monthly cost, upcoming renewals)

### UI Components 
- [x] Built dashboard with summary cards
- [x] Created subscriptions list table
- [x] Added upcoming renewals section
- [x] Implemented test form for adding sample data
- [x] Built proper subscription form with all fields
- [x] Implemented form validation
- [x] Added edit and delete functionality

### Offline Capabilities
- [x] Implemented automatic detection of online/offline status
- [x] Set up automatic data persistence to local storage
- [x] Created sync status indicators in the data model

### Backend Implementation
- [x] Created NestJS project with TypeScript
- [x] Configured ESLint and Prettier to match frontend
- [x] Implemented database module with Turso (libSQL) connection
- [x] Designed database schema matching TinyBase model
- [x] Built JWT-based authentication for single user
- [ ] Implementing API endpoints for subscription operations
- [ ] Creating synchronization endpoints

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 3: 5 days (backend + sync) - In progress (40% complete)
  - Backend setup ✅
  - API endpoints and synchronization - In progress
- Phase 4: 3 days
- Phase 5: 2 days
- Phase 6: Ongoing

Total development time: ~18 days
